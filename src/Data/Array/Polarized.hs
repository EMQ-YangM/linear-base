-- | This module provides converters and documentation for polarized arrays.
--
-- There are two polarities or \"directions\": push arrays and pull arrays.
--
-- You should use push an pull arrays if you want to explicity control
-- when GHC allocates space in the garbage-collector heap for arrays.
-- The point of doing this is to reduce the amount of memory used
-- and improve the performance of your program.
--
-- The performance of your program is improved because linear types enable the
-- API which does not allow operations on push or pull arrays that cannot be
-- fused. That is, for some subtle and complicated reasons, we can be sure that
-- only one function allocates memory (and it's called 'alloc') and all other
-- compositions do not allocate memory.
--
-- == How to use push and pull arrays
--
-- __The trifecta of controlling allocation:__
--
-- \[ \texttt{Vector a} \]
-- \[ \text{fromVector}~~ { \Huge \swarrow  ~~~~ \nwarrow } ~~~ \text{alloc} \]
-- \[ \texttt{Pull a} {\Huge ~~~ \longrightarrow ~~~} \texttt{Push a}\]
-- \[ \text{transfer}\]
--
-- Pull arrays are good as arguments to functions, because they are easy to
-- \"pull\" from, map over and zip with.
--
-- Push arrays are good as values returned from functions, and are easy to
-- \"write\" to and modify.
--
-- A typical application starts with concrete lists as @Vector@s (which are
-- inputs), goes to @Pull@ arrays, then to @Push@ arrays and ends with
-- @Vector@s (which are outputs).  All the computations inbetween the
-- "fromVector" and "alloc" are fused and no memory from the GC heap is
-- allocated when they are executed.
--
-- Such a combination of functions that controls fusion is called 
-- a __fusion pipeline__.

-- DEVELOPER NOTE:
--
-- The general spirit is: `Push.Array` are those arrays which are friendly in
-- returned-value position. And `Pull.Array` are those arrays which are friendly
-- in argument position. If you have more than one array in an unfriendly
-- position, you need to allocate (allocated arrays are friendly in all
-- positions).
--
-- There are three types of array which are involved, with conversion
-- functions available between them, the third being an allocated Vector.
-- The primary conversion functions are:
--
-- > Polarized.transfer :: Pull.Array a #-> Push.Array a
-- > Push.alloc :: Push.Array a #-> Vector a
-- > Pull.fromVector :: Vector a #-> Pull.Array a
--
-- In this way, we gain further control over exactly when allocation may occur
-- in a fusion pipeline.
-- In such a pipeline converting one allocated array to another, it would be
-- common to begin with Pull.fromVector, and end with Push.alloc.


-- | Convert a PullArray into a PushArray.
-- NOTE: this does NOT require allocation and can be in-lined.
transfer :: Pull.Array a #-> Push.Array a
transfer (Pull.Array f n) = Push.Array (\g -> DArray.fromFunction (\i -> g (f i))) n

-- | This is a shortcut convenience function, which does
-- the same thing as `transfer` . `Pull.fromVector`
walk :: Vector a #-> Push.Array a
walk = transfer . Pull.fromVector
